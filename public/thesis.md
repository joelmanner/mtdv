It looks like most social media end up in the same place: autoplaying videos on a hyper-personalized algorithmic feed. Posts made by people we chose to follow are given less space to make way for more content made by content creators competing for our attention.

Engagement metrics clearly show that's what most people want. Is that really the end state, though? Sometimes we wonder: is this just the fast food of digital products? Could there be new formats - something more imaginative, more tasteful, and closer to real world interactions?

Maybe it's a content supply problem? Maybe it's the true revealed preference of people? That's what we're set to find out.
